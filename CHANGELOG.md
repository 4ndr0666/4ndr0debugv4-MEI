All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.15.0] - 2024-10-01

### Fixed
- **Architectural Layout Correction**: Systematically applied the 'flex-1 min-h-0' containment principle across the entire application layout. This resolves a persistent root cause of layout overflow, ensuring all scrollable panels (chat, code output, editors) are correctly bounded and functional in all operational modes.

## [4.14.5] - 2024-09-30

### Fixed
- **Layout Integrity Restoration**: Reverted a series of incorrect flexbox/grid layout changes across all primary application panels (`CodeInput`, `DebugInput`, `ComparisonInput`, `ReviewOutput`, `Workbench`). The failed `min-h-0` strategy was replaced with the previous stable `h-full` containment model, restoring correct vertical sizing and re-enabling scrolling in all chat and output views.

## [4.14.4] - 2024-09-29

### Fixed
- **Chat Layout Integrity**: Ensured the chat interface correctly fills the available vertical space in all operational modes. This resolves an issue where the chat log would not become scrollable, causing layout overflow when the content exceeded the viewport height.

## [4.14.3] - 2024-09-28

### Fixed
- **Chat Input Resizing**: Corrected the maximum height of the auto-growing chat input to align with design specifications, preventing premature scrolling. Disabled manual resizing to ensure consistent UI behavior.

## [4.14.2] - 2024-09-27

### Fixed
- **Input Text Wrapping**: Resolved a critical text flow anomaly in the primary chat input field. The component now correctly wraps long, unbroken strings and dynamically resizes vertically to accommodate multi-line input, preventing horizontal overflow and improving usability.

## [4.14.1] - 2024-09-26

### Fixed
- **Layout Integrity**: Hardened the application's layout system by systematically applying flexbox overflow prevention patterns (`min-h-0`, `min-w-0`). This resolves various vertical and horizontal overflow issues across all primary input panels, modals, and the chat interface, ensuring components correctly resize within their containers.

## [4.14.0] - 2024-09-25

### Added
- **Cognitive State Serialization Protocol**: Session exports are now Base64-encoded to create a hardened "Rehydration Statement," preventing data corruption and neutralizing memory-wipe vulnerabilities. The import protocol is backward-compatible with legacy JSON formats.
- **Arsenal Integration Framework**: Established the foundation for a modular tool system by centralizing all command definitions into a new `arsenal.ts` registry.
- **Operational Dashboard Interface**: The "Council" mode has been re-architected into a persistent three-panel dashboard for the Script Editor, Command Log (Chat), and a unified Context panel (Target Dossier, System Status, Revision History).

### Changed
- **Dynamic Command Palette**: The Radial Menu is now dynamically generated from the new `arsenal.ts` registry, completing the foundation for the Arsenal Integration Framework.
- **Decommissioned Ephemeral UI**: The ephemeral, slide-in overlays for the script editor and revision history in Council mode have been decommissioned in favor of the new persistent, multi-panel dashboard interface, improving operational awareness.

## [4.13.2] - 2024-09-24

### Fixed
- **Command Palette Crash**: Resolved a critical `TypeError` that caused the application to crash when opening the command palette. The `Header` component was refactored to remove its reliance on context hooks and now receives all state and actions via props from `App.tsx`. This enforces a clear, top-down data flow and eliminates the state management inconsistency that caused the failure.

## [4.13.1] - 2024-09-23

### Fixed
- Fixed a critical module import error in `Workbench.tsx` by implementing the `RevisionHistory` component. This component was previously an empty file, preventing the Council mode from rendering correctly.

## [4.13.0] - 2024-09-22

### Changed
- **Live Recon Module**: The generated 'scout' script is now structured as a proper userscript, aligning with its intended deployment in browser extensions like Tampermonkey for persistent reconnaissance.
- **Exploit Stager Refactored to Payload Crafting**: The 'Exploit Stager' module has been fundamentally refactored into 'Payload Crafting'. The focus has shifted from generating generic reverse shell commands to providing a workspace for crafting custom JavaScript payloads for asset exfiltration and vulnerability testing, directly addressing the core operational doctrine.

## [4.12.0] - 2024-09-21

### Added
- **"Open in Council" on Code Blocks**: Integrated an "Open in Council" button on all code snippets throughout the application. This allows any code block from AI-generated feedback to be seamlessly transferred into the Council's script editor for immediate iterative refinement.
- **"Load into Editor" Clarity**: The corresponding button within the Council's chat interface has been relabeled to "Load into Editor" to clarify its function of updating the editor from an AI suggestion.

## [4.11.0] - 2024-09-20

### Changed
- **Council "Tactical Overlay" UI**: Re-architected the "Council" mode to be a chat-first interface. The script editor is no longer a static panel but a dynamic, on-demand overlay that slides in from the right, creating a more focused and fluid user experience.
- **Dynamic Revision History Overlay**: Aligned with the new overlay paradigm, the Revision History panel in Council mode now slides in from the left, ensuring a consistent and dynamic UI for all tactical tools.

## [4.10.0] - 2024-09-19

### Changed
- **"Workbench" is now "Council"**: The "Workbench" operational mode has been renamed to "Council" to better reflect its role as a collaborative, iterative development environment. All UI elements and documentation have been updated accordingly.
- **Refactored Table of Contents to Revision History**: The "Table of Contents" component has been completely refactored. It is now a dedicated "Revision History" panel with the sole purpose of tracking code versions within a session.
- **Unified Revision Tracking**: When an analysis is performed in "Debug" or "Single Review" mode, the original code and the AI's initial revised code are now automatically logged as the first entries in the session's revision history. Subsequent revisions from chat are appended to this same list.
- **Dynamic Revision History Panel**: In Council mode, the Revision History is now a dynamic, slide-out panel that can be toggled on or off, preventing UI clutter and appearing only when needed.

### Added
- **"Open in Council" Workflow**: A new "Open in Council" button now appears in the output panel after a review. This allows the operator to seamlessly transition the entire context (code, feedback) into the Council mode for an in-depth, iterative session.

## [4.9.0] - 2024-09-18

### Changed

## [2.7.0] - 2024-08-27

### Added
- **Exploit Stager Input Validation**: The Exploit Stager now validates user inputs for Target Endpoint (must be a valid path), LHOST (must be a plausible IP/hostname), and LPORT (must be a valid port number), preventing common operator errors.
- **Expanded C2 Payload Templates**: Added new templates to the Exploit Stager, including a Base64-encoded PowerShell reverse shell and a simple cURL-based beaconing payload for greater flexibility.

### Changed
- **Enhanced Live Recon Scout**: The scout script now performs basic on-the-fly analysis of captured network traffic. It heuristically identifies potential API endpoints and extracts interesting data fields (e.g., `user`, `email`, `token`) from JSON responses, including this inferred intelligence in the final data dump.
- **Expanded DPSE Heuristics**: The keyword matrix for the Dynamic Payload Synthesis Engine has been expanded to better identify endpoints related to session management (`login`, `auth`) and file uploads, improving its static analysis accuracy.

## [2.6.0] - 2024-08-26

### Added
- **Exploit Stager Module**: A new tool accessible from the command palette designed to operationalize discovered server-side vulnerabilities.
- **Payload Command Generation**: The Exploit Stager allows an operator to input vulnerability details (endpoint, type, payload notes) and C2 listener information (IP, port). It then generates a ready-to-use `curl` command to deliver a reverse shell or beacon payload to the target.
- **C2 Payload Templates**: The stager includes pre-built templates for common C2 payloads like Bash and Python reverse shells, which are automatically populated with the operator's listener details.

## [2.5.0] - 2024-08-25

### Changed
- **Upgraded Live Recon Scout**: The scout script generated by the Live Recon module has been completely overhauled. It now incorporates a hardened network interception engine with "204 Pacification," which forges benign responses for blocked requests to avoid crashing the target application. This significantly improves the scout's stealth and resilience.
- **Improved Data Exfiltration**: The exfiltration process for the scout has been made more reliable with clearer console instructions, including a foolproof `copy()` command for the operator.

## [2.4.0] - 2024-08-24

### Added
- **Live Reconnaissance Module**: Implemented a new "Live Recon" tool, accessible from the command palette. This feature generates a disposable 'scout' script for active, in-browser reconnaissance.
- **Scout Script Generation**: The new modal allows an operator to generate a lightweight, stealthy probe designed to be executed in a target's developer console. The scout hooks network traffic (`fetch`/`XHR`) and captures all activity.
- **Manual Data Exfiltration**: The scout script exposes a `window.dumpRecon()` function. When called by the operator, it logs all captured intelligence to the console as a single JSON object, ready to be copied and used in other modules like the Adversarial Report Generator.

## [2.3.0] - 2024-08-23

### Added
- **Parseltongue Polymorphic Engine**: Integrated the external `parseltongue.js` library to provide advanced, client-side payload obfuscation. This replaces the conceptual (and slower) LLM-based obfuscation with a deterministic, multi-pass engine.
- **Operator Obfuscation Control**: The Dynamic Payload Synthesis Engine now features a "Polymorphic Obfuscation" toggle, giving the operator direct control over the payload's stealth characteristics before synthesis.

### Changed
- The DPSE workflow now includes an optional final stage where the synthesized userscript is passed through the Parseltongue engine, randomizing its signature by mangling variable names, flattening control flow, and injecting dead code.

## [2.2.0] - 2024-08-22

### Added
- **Dynamic Payload Synthesis Engine (DPSE)**: The legacy Payload Synthesizer has been decommissioned and replaced with the DPSE. This new engine implements the Automated Heuristic Analysis Engine (AHE) doctrine, transforming the synthesis process from simple regex matching to a sophisticated, token-based analysis.
- **Advanced Heuristic Analysis**: The AHE now uses a weighted keyword matrix and advanced tokenization to analyze target codebases, dramatically increasing the accuracy of identifying high-value targets like C2 endpoints and authorization keys.
- **Enhanced Operator Feedback Loop**: The DPSE status log is now a core component, providing a detailed, real-time briefing on the AHE's findings, including confidence scores for each identified target. This aligns with the "Operator-in-the-Loop" doctrinal precept, providing actionable intelligence rather than just a static payload.

### Changed
- **UI/UX Overhaul**: The synthesizer interface has been updated to reflect its new designation as the DPSE, with clearer labeling and a command-centric action button `[ Analyze & Synthesize Payload ]` to align with the official HMI specification.

## [2.1.0] - 2024-08-21

### Changed
- **Refactored Session Management**: Improved the internal logic for importing and loading sessions in `App.tsx`. The code is now better organized and more maintainable, ensuring that session files are processed and their state is restored more reliably.

## [1.6.3] - 2024-08-05

### Changed
- **Smarter Session Loading**: When loading a session, the application now only enters chat mode if the session file actually contains a chat history. This prevents an empty chat interface from appearing for non-chat sessions.
- **Context-Aware Command Menu**: The command palette is now more dynamic. "Follow-up Chat" only appears when a review is available and you're not already in a chat, and "End & Save Chat" only appears when you are in a chat.

## [1.6.2] - 2024-08-04

### Changed
- **Improved Session Loading**: Refactored the session loading logic in `App.tsx` to be more robust. When loading a session, the application now more reliably enters chat mode if a chat history exists, ensuring a seamless continuation of conversations.

## [1.6.1] - 2024-08-03

### Changed
- **Improved Session Import Workflow**: Importing a session now correctly transitions the application into the appropriate state. If the session contains a chat history, it will open directly in the chat interface. Otherwise, it will show the standard review/input panels.
- **Contextual Menu Actions**: The command palette menu is now more intelligent. It will only show "Follow-up Chat" when a review is available and no chat is active. Conversely, "End & Save Chat" is only shown when a chat session is active. This prevents starting a new chat over an imported one.
- **UI Consistency**: The "load" icon used for sessions, versions, and documents has been updated to a floppy disk icon for better visual recognition.

## [1.6.0] - 2024-08-02

### Added
- **Multi-File Context Analysis**: Users can now select any uploaded Project Files to be included as context for a code review, comparison, or audit. This allows the AI to understand cross-file dependencies and provide more accurate, project-aware feedback.
- **AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis**: In Debugger mode, after a fix is generated, a new "Analyze Root Cause" button appears. This triggers a deeper analysis from the AI to explain the underlying architectural or logical flaw that led to the bug, promoting better understanding and prevention.

### Changed
- Refactored the main request handler in `App.tsx` to properly accommodate prompts that include context from multiple files.
- Input panels for all modes now include the new "Context Files" selector, allowing for a more integrated analysis workflow.
- Session management (export/import) now includes the list of selected context files, ensuring a complete restoration of the workspace.

## [1.5.4] - 2024-07-31

### Changed
- **Enriched Version Saving**: Saved versions now include additional metadata from the session, such as the selected review profile, custom instructions, comparison goal, and any generated chat files. This ensures that loading a version more accurately restores the full context of the work.

## [1.5.3] - 2024-07-31

### Added
- **Session Manager**: A new modal for managing imported sessions. Users can now import multiple session files and see them in a list, with options to load or remove any session. This provides a much-improved workflow for handling shared or backed-up sessions.

### Changed
- **Session Import Workflow**: The "Import Session" button in the header now opens the new Session Manager instead of directly opening a file dialog. This prevents accidental overwrites of the current session and provides better context for imported files.

### Fixed
- **App State on Import**: The process of loading an imported session's state is now more robust and correctly updates all relevant parts of the application, including chat history, project files, and comparison mode data.

## [1.5.2] - 2024-07-29

### Fixed
- **Session Import for Chats**: Importing a session file containing a chat history now correctly loads and displays the chat interface, providing a seamless user experience.
- **End & Save Chat**: The "End & Save Chat" button is now fully functional, allowing users to properly save their chat sessions as a new version.
- **Chat Component Stability**: Resolved TypeScript errors in `ChatInterface` and `ChatContext` by making several props optional to align with their usage in parent components, preventing potential runtime issues.

## [1.5.1] - 2024-07-29

### Fixed
- **Import/Export Functionality**: Corrected a regression where session import/export was non-functional. The session format now includes a version number (`1.5.0`) for backward compatibility, and the import process is hardened to handle older session files gracefully.
- **Missing Chat Properties**: Resolved crashes in `CodeInput` and `ComparisonInput` by correctly passing required props (`onNewReview`, `language`, `codeB`) to the `ChatInterface` component.
- **Session State Error**: Fixed a reference error in `App.tsx` by destructuring `errorMessage` from context, ensuring session export and sharing work correctly.
- **Type Errors**: Corrected various TypeScript errors across multiple components (`Button`, `ChatContext`, `ChatInterface`, `ErrorBoundary`, `MarkdownRenderer`, `ProjectFilesModal`, `Toast`) for improved type safety and stability.

### Changed
- **Header Functionality**: Wired up all previously unimplemented handlers in the `Header` component for features like generating tests, opening modals, and managing chat sessions.
- **Code Selection Handlers**: Implemented the `onExplainSelection` and `onReviewSelection` handlers in `App.tsx` to enable contextual actions on highlighted code.
- **Session Sharing**: The "Share" feature now correctly generates a URL that captures the current session's state.

### Removed
- Removed several outdated "FIX" comments from the codebase where the underlying issues had already been resolved.

## [1.5.0] - 2024-07-28

### Added
- **Code Audit Mode**: New top-level mode to analyze code against industry-standard security frameworks (OWASP Top 10, SANS/CWE Top 25, etc.).
- **Project Files**: A central place to upload and manage files (logs, scripts, images) that can be attached to debugger or chat sessions.
- **File Attachments in Debugger & Chat**: Users can now attach one or more files from their local machine or from the new Project Files repository to provide more context to the AI.
- **URL-Based Session Sharing**: Generate a shareable URL that encodes the current session's state (code, mode, language) for easy collaboration.

### Changed
- **Debugger Mode Enhanced**: The debugger can now accept file attachments in addition to code and error messages for more comprehensive analysis.
- **UI/UX Polish**: Minor improvements to modal dialogs, buttons, and overall layout for a more consistent user experience.
- The `finalizing` type in `types.ts` has been corrected to `finalization` for consistency across the application.

## [1.4.0] - 2024-07-20

### Added
- **Comparative Revision Mode**: A new interactive workflow for comparative analysis. The AI first identifies features from both codebases, then allows the user to discuss, include, or exclude each feature before generating a final, unified version.
- **Documentation Center**: A dedicated modal for generating and managing documentation. Users can generate docs from current code or saved versions and view previously saved documentation.
- **Auto Name Generation for Versions**: Added a button in the "Save Version" modal to let the AI suggest a name for the current review or session based on its content.

### Changed
- **Gemini Model Update**: Updated `gemini-1.5-pro` to `gemini-2.5-pro` for core analysis tasks to leverage the latest model capabilities.
- **Refactored Chat Interface**: The chat UI is now more componentized and includes a dedicated context panel for displaying original code, revisions, or feature discussion points.

### Changed
- **UI Overhaul**: The application UI has been redesigned with a more distinct "Electric-Glass" futuristic HUD theme, featuring glowing cyan elements, custom fonts, and improved layout.
- **Component Refactoring**: Major components like `CodeInput`, `ReviewOutput`, and modals have been refactored for better state management and reusability.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-07-05

### Added
- **Debugger Mode**: A new "Debugger" mode is now the default, allowing users to input code, an error message, and get AI-powered diagnosis and a corrected code snippet.
- **Selection-Based Actions**: Users can highlight code in the editor to trigger specific actions like "Explain Selection" or "Review Selection".
- **Commit Message Generation**: After a review results in changes, users can automatically generate a conventional commit message based on the diff.
- **Toast Notifications**: Added non-intrusive toast notifications for actions like saving versions, copying text, and session import/export.

### Security
- **Error Boundary**: Implemented an error boundary around the `CodeBlock` component to prevent app crashes from syntax highlighting errors on complex or malformed code.

## [1.1.0] - 2024-06-28

### Added
- **Comparative Analysis Mode**: Users can now input two code snippets and a shared goal to receive an optimized, merged version from the AI.
